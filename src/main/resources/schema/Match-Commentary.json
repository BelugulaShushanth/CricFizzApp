Australia could be without Lyon (calf injury), and England might miss the services of Ollie Pope (shoulder injury). And for all that extra effort from the pacers, they will have just 3 days to recover as Headingley awaits to host the third and most-crucial Test of the Ashes from an England point of view. Home ground for Root, Brook and Bairstow but having won 2 already, Australia will feel more at home with the conditions. Bazball or Bumperball, it is gonna be entertaining for sure.

Happy to go 2-0 up. (On Bairstow wicket) B1$(On Nathan Lyon) These were perfect conditions for him on day 5, to win without him was a great win. I wasn’t too happy to see him walk out to bat but he was keen to get out there. He did amazing and those 15-20 runs were crucial.

Definitely felt we had a shout, but Australia changed their plans and that changed things for me. I had to take my risks to the longer side of the ground. Tough one to swallow, but it was a fantastic game. We are 2-0 down but we got 3 games to go. We have won 3-0 against Pakistan, 3-0 against NZ so we have the belief that we can do it. Quite some factors about that dismissal, I was looking at the umpires if they had called the over, they said no. At the end of the day, it is out. If the shoe was in the other foot, I’d probably have to think about this atmosphere and decide what to do. It has happened, it is out! When you win the toss and bowl, you want to restrict them under 300 and the first day the lads got criticism, but the number of times the ball missed the bat was frustrating. Great effort from the guys to keep bowling that way. The effort and energy everyone has put in can’t be faulted. In the end, we have lost the Test match but lots of positives to take. (On first innings approach) B1$ (On Josh Tongue) First game against Ireland I didn’t know him well, I knew him as a great prospect. He has been brilliant. Great find for us, incredible the way he took responsibility and bowled for us. Quick turnaround now and we are 2-0 down, but we can make it 3-2.",

He is a freak for what he can pull off in cricket - in different formats, on this ground, in this country, he has done some incredible things. He was targeting the short end, and the first shot that he tried the other end, he got out. (On the dropped catch) I didn’t pick it initially, quite difficult square of the wicket to pick the ball and eventually put it down. Difficult giving such guys a life, fortunately hit one up the chimney later on. (On first innings) I think it was important to get a decent total on the board, we were looking to bowl as well looking at the overheads. To be able to navigate that stage and put a decent total helped us out. Incredible game of cricket. (On the shot ball ploy) It was a bit two-paced with variable bounce, wasn’t easy and there wasn’t much on offer when you pitched the ball up. So it was one way to shut the scoring and both teams kept playing rash shots. (On Lyon batting) They play a dangerous brand and we never know what is safe.

On expected lines, Stokes mistimed one fourth ball after lunch and Steve Smith, of all people, dropped a relatively easy catch at deep backward square. At that particular moment, one could sense Australia feeling a tad fidgety with shades of Headingley running on the back of their minds. The crowd too got into the act and started cheering for every single run as if their life depended on it. And the boos, of course, never stopped for Australia. It was so wild that former England skipper Nasser Hussain, on comms, admitted that \"B1$.\" Stokes continued to take his chances and with under 90 runs to get, Australia's senior men got together to devise a plan and it, eventually, proved fruitful. The plan was to take it wide of off-stump and frustrate Stokes by drying out boundaries. They stuck to the plan and got Stokes to top-edge a slog. Hazlewood should have had him first over after lunch, but he, ultimately, had him in his first over after drinks.",

With an injured calf, on one leg, he walked out to bat and added some vital runs for the last-wicket partnership and it did prove very handy for Australia who managed to escape the Stokes' scare.
